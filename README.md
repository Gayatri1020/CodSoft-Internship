- **Interactive Display** : The .display class updates the content dynamically, and your JavaScript handles the input and calculation logic, updating the display accordingly.
- **Operator Functionality** : In the JavaScript code, you have logic to handle different operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide), as well as the equal function to calculate the result.
